Eyes wide in this reverie but its all still dark as night
Im falling fast asleep
Black tides of my misery coming down upon my sight
I drown into the deep
Is there but a ghost inside these bones
Come now My darling Come now beloved My love it calls you
Am I just a ghost inside these bones
Walking as the dead hearts made of stone
Nightmares of my darkest fears all around crippled with fright
Im falling fast asleep
Come now My darling Come now beloved My love it calls you
Come away My darling Come now beloved My love remains for you
Im lost so long
The spirits willing but the flesh is weak
I hear Your song
My fears are chilling so I dare not speak
For you My blood was spilled
But I made my bed in hell
In you I see no guilt
But you know how far I fell
Oh may it wake you from your sleep
Am I just a ghost inside these bones
Walking as the dead hearts made of stone
Hasten up my feet so I may fly
Wash me now my God or I will die
Black tides of my misery coming down upon my sight
Come now My darling Come now beloved My love it calls you
Come away My darling Come now beloved My love remains for you
Im lost so long
The spirits willing but the flesh is weak
I hear Your song
My fears are chilling so I dare not speak
Though You know how far I fell
Youve saved my soul from hell
