I walk the face of earth once more 
a mindless puppet my strings are torn 
the creaky bones the bad eyesight 
yet the chance to turn wrong to right 
wars a waging old mans guilt 
the worlds now on more then just a tilt 
parents weeping children slain 
bloody thoughts fear will reign 
I look in the shadows a creature did lurk 
he whispered to me hiding a smirk 
Thou shalt be killed if thee cant find 
the demon lurking in thou mind 
So off I ventured to quench my thirst 
of corpses piled with hearts a burst 
And on that quest what did I see
