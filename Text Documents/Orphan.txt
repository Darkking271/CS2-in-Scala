Respective perspectives worshiping directives
Blindly killing for our dogma 
Until our sons meet in the garden 
Torches scald the night sky
The youth rise up and set their elders to the gallows 
Fire in the lighthouse
All our advances a spark away from conflagration
In the night I saw you fall oh wicked star 
Illuminate our hate show us who we really are
Books were burned away only swords remained 
The prophets died for peace stabbed by preying priests
As the wise man said Ill keep my heart and lose my head
Without a neck how can I sink with a millstone to the bottom of the sea
The bottom of the sea
And Im finding the violence it looks like me
Singing songs of life when all we know is death 
A world of orphans left empty-handed
If loves a sin Ill become a heretic
Recurring intervention 
Framing the narrative to cleanse our tainted conscience 
Harvesting destruction
Reaping the sow from weapons planted in the soil
Terrified little son encumbered by your sword
You can hide your fear but wont shed the sheer
Weight of your own humanity humanity
You can face me towards the mountains 
Where I meet our Mothers gaze 
Too blinded by this hatred to recognize your brothers face
Singing songs of life when all we know is death
A world of orphans left empty-handed
Ill collapse head parting from my weary shoulders
Seeds of life spilling from my palms 
Subverting love will take hold in this hateful soil
My blood is the water
Inshallah Shalom
Love will take hold
