Oh I wanted to see a fire ablaze in my heart 
A flame not full of smoke 
I know Your love is a fire 
Why am I so cold 
My flesh it screams Youre a liar 
Those cries are so old 
The smoke ascends the embers dim 
Just follow its trail 
Help me Im so weak and so frail 
Im waiting for a reaction and the motions in between 
Im looking for You 
Every night I watch and wait as my candles burning out 
Every night I scream and shout as my patience turns to doubt 
Stay with Me my flickering flame 
Stay with Me I know your name 
Quit your fight it is in vain 
When your flame takes flight it will last the pouring rain 
Im waiting flame smoking and fading out 
Im fading withering will I weather 
Im waiting sustain me help me weather 
Im fading flame smoking flickering and fading out 
Oh I wanted to feel the re before mine goes out 
A flame so bright it blinds 
Im waiting for a reaction and the motions in between 
Im looking for You right now 
Stay with Me flickering flame I know youre name 
Every night Ill watch and wait as my candles burning out 
Every night Im filled with doubt I will cry to You and shout
